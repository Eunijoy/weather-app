# Responsive Weather App (Mock API)

A modern and responsive Weather Dashboard built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.  
This project uses a mock weather API to demonstrate dynamic UI updates, clean design, and frontend logic without relying on real-time external services.

The application features a professional light-mode interface inspired by modern SaaS dashboards and weather applications.

## How It Works

This project uses predefined mock weather data stored in JavaScript.

1. The user enters a city name in the search bar
2. The app searches the mock data for the matching city
3. Weather details are updated dynamically, including:
   - Current temperature
   - Weather condition
   - Hourly forecast
   - Weekly forecast
   - Wind speed
   - Chance of rain
   - UV index
4. If the city is not found, the app displays a fallback message

Because no real API is used, the app works offline once loaded.

## Customization

You can easily customize this project by:
